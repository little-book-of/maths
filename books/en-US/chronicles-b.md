### B3. Motion & Change

*Mathematics becomes alive when it learns to move. From the turning of planets to the flow of rivers and the growth of populations, the study of change gave birth to calculus — the grammar of becoming. This cluster traces how motion, variation, and transformation turned static quantity into dynamic law.*

### B4. Logic & Proof

*At the heart of mathematics lies the quest for certainty — to distinguish truth from illusion, necessity from belief. Logic gives structure to reasoning; proof transforms intuition into knowledge. From Aristotle’s syllogisms to Gödel’s incompleteness, this cluster charts humanity’s attempt to formalize thought itself.*

### B5. Data & Probability

*When the world became too vast to grasp, humanity turned to data — to count, record, and reason from uncertainty. Probability transformed ignorance into insight, and statistics turned variation into knowledge. This cluster explores how randomness, evidence, and inference became pillars of modern understanding.*

### B9. Philosophy & Foundations

*Beneath every theorem lies a belief; beneath every equation, a worldview. Mathematics and computation do not float above culture — they emerge from it. This cluster examines the philosophical bedrock of the mathematical mind: number as narrative, logic as law, knowledge as construction, and truth as choice.*
